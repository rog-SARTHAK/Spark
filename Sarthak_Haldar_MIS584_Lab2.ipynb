        "In this part, you need to use the techniques for PySpark RDD to read and process an external file that stores users' text reviews on businesses from Tucson.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, the external file, `text_reviews.txt`, has two columns separated by tabs (i.e., `\\t`). The first column stores each review's associated userr's ID, and the second column stores each review's text inforamtion. Please use the Spark techniques we discussed during the class to finish the following tasks:\n",
        "1. Read the text file using Spark's `textFile` function into an RDD; extract each line's user ID and review text by creating a customized mapper function and call the `map` transformation on the RDD. (1 point)\n",
        "2. Use the `distinct` action to return the total number of unique users in the dataset. Print the number. (0.5 point)\n",
        "3. Get the total number of reviews each user has posted using the `reduceByKey` transformation. Sort the transformed RDD by values (i.e., total number of reviews) in the descending order with the `sortBy` transformation. Print top 10 users who post the largest amount of reviews. (0.75 point)\n",
        "4. Get the total length of reviews (i.e., the total number of characters) each user has posted using the `reduceByKey` transformation. Sort the transformed RDD by values (i.e., total length of reviews) in the ascending order with the `sortBy` transformation. Print the 10 most quiet users (with the lowest total length of reviews). (0.75 point)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint**: For task 4, you might want to map each `(user_id, review_text)` tuple into `(user_id, len(review_text))`. After that, you can use the `reduceByKey` transformation to aggregate total length of reviews by users.\n",

        "In this part, you need to use the techniques for Spark SQL  to read and process an external file that stores users' individual reviews on businesses from Tucson.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, the external file, `user_reviews.csv`, has six attributes that are listed below.\n",
        "* `review_id`: a string-typed attribute indicating a review's ID\n",
        "* `user_id`: a string-typed attribute indicating the reviewer's ID\n",
        "* `business_id`: a string-typed attribute indicating the ID of the business that is reviewed\n",
        "* `review_stars`: a float-typed attribute indicating the review's star rating\n",
        "* `useful`: an integer-typed attribute indicating how many useful votes the review has received\n",
        "* `review_text`: a string-typed attribute storing the review's text\n",
        "\n",
        "Please use the Spark techniques we discussed during the class to finish the following tasks:\n",
        "1. Read the csv file using Spark SQL's `read.csv` function into a Spark DataFrame; customize the schema based on the information provided above when reading the file; print the DataFrame's schema after reading the data; show the first 20 rows. (1 point)\n",
        "2. For some unknown reasons, there are some reviews whose `review_id` **OR** `business_id` attribute is missing. Fill the missing values from the DataFrame with the string \"missing\" using the `fillna` transformation and drop the missing values from the DataFrame. Print how many rows are left after removing rows with missing values. (0.75 point)\n",
        "3. Create a new column named `review_text_length` that stores the length of the review using the `withColumn` transformation. Notice that you need to use the `length` function provided by Spark SQL's functions library. See the [official document](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.3/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.functions.length.html) for how to use the function. (0.75 point)\n",
        "4. Using the `groupby` transformation, group the DataFrame by `user_id` so as to calculate the following values for each user. Round each value to 2 decimals and choose a meaningful alias for each value. Sort the grouped dataframe by total useful votes (in descending order) and average star rating (in ascending order); show the first 20 rows (1.5 point).\n",
        "    * average star rating the user gives\n",
        "    * average review length the user gives\n",
        "    * total useful votes the user has received\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint**: For task 2, you might want to filter the DataFrame so that only rows with non-missing `review_id` and `business_id` attributes are kept."
